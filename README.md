# üöÄ FastAPI Template

An opinionated template for a FastAPI project with PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and `uv` as the package manager.

## üéâ Demo Project

This project implements a basic link shortener API. It allows you to create a short link for a given URL and redirect to
the original URL using the short link.

Optionally, you can add an expiration date to the short link, making it invalid after the specified date.

### Decisions

#### Controller

I prefer using FastAPI for its ease of use and neat features, such as automatic OpenAPI documentation generation,
dependency injection, and Pydantic integration.

#### Database

I chose PostgreSQL because it is a powerful and reliable database system. It also supports arrays and JSON fields, which
can be useful for certain use cases.

SQLAlchemy is a powerful ORM. In its new version 2.0 Query System, it offers a more modern API and better performance.
Because of this, I chose to use Alembic for migrations.

If the team is more comfortable with raw SQL, I would use psycopg(3) directly.

#### Testing

Pytest provides useful features for testing, such as fixtures and parameterized tests, and it has a rich ecosystem of
plugins.

Since I am not using PostgreSQL-specific features, I use an in-memory SQLite database for testing. Otherwise, I would
use Testcontainers to replicate the production environment. While Testcontainers ensure accuracy, they introduce a
performance penalty and require proper setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This project can be started using Docker Compose or by starting PostgreSQL and the controller locally.

### üê≥ Docker Compose

A general build process first starts the PostgreSQL container, then applies the Alembic migrations, and finally starts
the FastAPI controller.

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
